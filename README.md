## Getting Started
### Setting up the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Locate the file docker_setup.ps1 in the root of the project and run this in PowerShell which will setup the Docker Containers and Dependencies.

### Using SQL Server Express
1. To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and then open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Once the solution is open, you will want to build the solution. This will download all of the NuGet packages that are required or the project.
3. Open the Database.Example project and build the project then publish using the "StartupExample.publish.xml" profile.
4. There should be no need to update the secrets.json file with the connection string as it should be configured in the appsettings.json file for SQL Express.

### Using Docker Containers
1. Start Visual Studio and open the solution.
2. Open the Database.Example project and build the project then publish using the "StartupExample.Docker.publish.xml" profile. Using the default password of "P@ssword123!".
3. MailHog was added as an email trap.
4. Open Telemetry was added to the project to help with debugging and development and can be found [here](http://localhost:4341/) after starting the docker containers.
   1. Watch the following video for why and how its used: [The Logging Everyone Should Be Using in .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHJ0BHfWhRw)

### Running the Applications
1. Once the project has been built and the database has been created, you can run any of the applications.

## CodeSpaces

If you are using CodeSpaces you'll want to update your container git configuration profile. Be sure to update with your appropriate name and email details.

winget install Microsoft.Azure.FunctionsCoreTools
```

### CommandLine Git Client

‚úÖ Required Resource ‚úÖ

This adds the windows GIT client to interact with git based repositories.

```
winget install Git.Git
```

### Visual Git Clients

üëç Recommended üëç

These are two recommended GUI wrapper clients for the git Cli. These are not required but maybe helpful in managing repository changes and visualizing history and branching better. Atlassian's tool works very well at providing a history tree view for tracking changes. Both Visual Studio and VS Code have git support making these tools optional.

```
winget install Atlassian.Sourcetree
winget install GitHub.GitHubDesktop
```

### Primarily used for Git Merge Conflicts, compares files and folders

üëç Recommended üëç <br />
‚≠ê License Required ‚≠ê

When performing merging of branches, the BeyondCompare tool has been fantastic. This tool also supports comparisons between folders making it easier to perform diffs between two large directory structures. This tool also integrates well with Atlassian Source Tree.

```
winget install ScooterSoftware.BeyondCompare.5
```

### Azure

If you need to work with Azure Blob Storage this Visual GUI tool provides easy access and management of content stored in an Storage resource in Azure.

```
winget install Microsoft.Azure.StorageEmulator
winget install Microsoft.Azure.StorageExplorer
```

### Http Gui Client

üëç Recommended üëç

You can install either Postman or Bruno

```
winget install Postman.Postman
winget install Bruno.Bruno
```

### Local Database Engine, SQL Server Express

üëç Recommended üëç

Having a local instance of SQL Server can be helpful for development purposes.

‚ö†Ô∏è No church data from our servers maybe copied into your local database, Scrubbed data only ‚ö†Ô∏è

```
winget install Microsoft.SQLServer.2022.Express
```

### IDE and Text Editors

‚úÖ Required Resource ‚úÖ

Our primary development must use Visual Studio and / or Visual Studio Code

```
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.Enterprise
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

üëç Recommended üëç

Having the ability to query the database is required, however, SQL Server Management Studio is recommended as the primary tool for doing so.
Notepad++ is a lightweight text editor that is very handy.

```
winget install Microsoft.SQLServerManagementStudio
winget install Notepad++.Notepad++
```

### Entity Framework and Database tools

‚≠ê License Required ‚≠ê

Only request this tool if there is a use case that is needed.
This tool makes querying databases very nice. It provides support for LINQ or direct queries. You can also validate / verify queries using LINQ within this editor making testing easier when developing Entity Framework calls to the database.

```
winget install LINQPad.LINQPad.7
```

### VS 2022 Addon Tools Extensions

üëç Recommended üëç <br />
‚≠ê License Required ‚≠ê

Highly recommended. This tool should be used periodically for its refactor and C# linting fix up capabilities for C# code.

### Docker / Container Services

üëç Recommended üëç <br />
‚≠ê License Required ‚≠ê

This resource provides local development tools and resources will speed up developer setup and configuration and provide diagnostic and debugging resources not previously available. The number of options and tools is near limitless.

```
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop
```

### Update Dotnet workloads

üëç Recommended üëç

It is recommended to periodically run the dotnet workload update command, as this will help keep your local development tools and resources up to date. Running Visual Studio updates do not always update all of the dotnet resources.
If you desire experimenting with Aspire resources it is recommended to install the wasm-tools and aspire workloads.
Lastly, the LibraryManager provides resources for using libman.json configuration files to automatically download web resources such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and other libraries for web development.

‚ö†Ô∏è .NET Aspire, approval is pending Architecture review ‚ö†Ô∏è

```
dotnet workload update
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
dotnet workload install aspire
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli
```

## Getting the project setup

### Configure unsigned PowerShell scripts to run locally

This will update PowerShell permissions settings to grant unsigned scripts access to run locally.

Run as local machine administrator

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

### DevContainers

üëç Recommended üëç <br />
‚ö†Ô∏è Provisional Approval ‚ö†Ô∏è <br />

A DevContainer is a development environment defined by a Docker container, which includes all necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies for a project. It ensures a consistent development setup across different machines, simplifies onboarding, and enhances productivity by providing a pre-configured environment that mirrors production settings. DevContainers are commonly used with Visual Studio Code to streamline development workflows and improve collaboration.

[DevContainer Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

‚ö†Ô∏è Helpful resources ‚ö†Ô∏è <br />

The following Docker Images and Container resources are provisionally approved for local development environment use ONLY. These images and resources may *not* at any time be deployed outside of your local development environment. They are to be used as tools, utilities, and resources at the local development level only. Additionally, at no time should church data be replicated to a local laptop. If you have questions regarding this policy please reach out to your Engineering Manager or Portfolio Architect.
