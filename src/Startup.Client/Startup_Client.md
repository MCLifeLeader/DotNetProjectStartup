# Startup Client

This library consumes the swagger.json OpenAPI generated by StartupClient and provides a http client for connecting with the StartupClient API services.

## Updating the client

- Start the Startup API web application running locally. Which can be done by running the following PowerShell script - .\Start_StartupExample_Api.ps1
- Right click on the CSPROJ file and select "Add" -> "Connected Service".
- Locate the Service Reference for "swagger - Client".
- Click the ellipsis button and select "Refresh".

This will download the latest swagger.json file from the StartupClient API and update the client and generate the client code from the auto code generation tool.
